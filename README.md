Question 1.
THE FOLLOWING TEXT EXPLAINS THE CODES WHICH SHOWS HOW IT WORKS AND FUNCTIONS IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS.
This is a simple C++ program that demonstrates how to output text to the console.
Code Breakdown:
using namespace std;
This line tells the C++ program to use the standard namespace (std).
The namespace is a container for identifiers like functions, objects, and variables to avoid naming conflicts.
std is the standard namespace where C++'s library functions (such as cout, cin, endl, etc.) are defined.
By adding using namespace std;, you can use C++ library functions without prefixing them with std::. For example, cout instead of std::cout.
int main()
This is the main function where the program execution begins. In every C++ program, there must be a main() function.
int indicates that the function returns an integer value, typically used to represent the status code upon termination. Returning 0 usually means successful execution.

cout << "Hello, World!";
cout stands for character output. It's an object used to display output to the console.
The << operator is called the stream insertion operator, which is used to send data to the output stream (in this case, the console).
"Hello, World!" is the string that you want to print. This string will be displayed on the screen when the program is run.
return 0;

This line ends the main function and returns a value to the operating system.
Returning 0 indicates that the program finished successfully without errors. The number 0 is a standard convention for successful execution, while other values (like 1) may indicate errors or abnormal termination.
Execution Flow:
The program begins by executing main().
using namespace std; allows you to use functions from the standard library easily.
It then outputs "Hello, World!" to the screen using cout.
Finally, it ends the program and returns 0, signifying that everything ran as expected.

Question 2.

using namespace std;
This line tells the compiler to use the standard namespace (std) so that standard library functions and objects (like cout, cin, and endl) can be used without explicitly stating std:: each time.
Main Function Declaration:
int main() {
The main() function is where the program starts. Every C++ program must have a main() function. It returns an integer, typically 0, to indicate that the program has completed successfully.
Variable Declarations and Initializations:

Integer Variable (age):
int age = 20;
age is an integer variable that stores whole numbers. It is initialized to 20.
Double Variable (price):

double price = 19.99;
price is a double variable used for storing floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals). It is initialized to 19.99.
Character Variable (grade):

char grade = 'A';
grade is a char variable used to store a single character. In this case, it holds the letter 'A'.
String Variable (name):

string name = "Alice";
name is a string variable, which is used to store a sequence of characters (text). It is initialized to the string "Alice".
Output Statements Using cout:

Output Name:

cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
The cout object is used to print the name variable (which holds the string "Alice") followed by a newline (via endl).
Output Age:

cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
Prints the value stored in the age variable (which is 20) followed by a newline.
Output Price:

cout << "Price: $" << price << endl;
Prints the value stored in the price variable (which is 19.99) with a dollar sign $ before it, followed by a newline.
Output Grade:

cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl;
Prints the value stored in the grade variable (which is 'A') followed by a newline.
Return Statement:
return 0;
Ends the main() function and returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.

Question 3.

This C++ program takes user input for name and age, then outputs a personalized greeting message with the user's name and age.
Code Breakdown:
using namespace std;
using namespace std;
This tells the compiler to use the standard namespace (std), so we don't need to prefix standard library functions (like cout, cin, and endl) with std::.
Main Function Declaration:
int main() {
The program starts execution from the main() function. The int return type indicates that this function returns an integer, typically 0 to indicate successful execution.
Variable Declarations:

String Variable (name):
string name;
name is declared as a string variable to hold the user's name.
Integer Variable (age):

int age;
age is declared as an integer variable to store the user's age.
Input for Name:

cout << "Enter your name: ";
cin >> name;
The program prints "Enter your name: " using cout to prompt the user for their name.
cin is used to read input from the user. The user s input (their name) is stored in the name variable.
Input for Age:

cout << "Enter your age: ";
cin >> age;
The program prints "Enter your age: " to prompt the user for their age.
The input is read using cin and stored in the age variable.
Output the Greeting Message:

cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You are " << age << " years old." << endl;
The program uses cout to print a personalized greeting message.
It outputs "Hello, " followed by the user's name, then the message "You are " followed by the user's age, and ends the line with endl.
<< is used to concatenate the string literals and variables, creating a complete message.
Return Statement:
return 0;
The main() function ends and returns 0, signaling that the program has finished successfully.
Expected Output

Question 4.

Detailed Explanation of the C++ Program:
This C++ program demonstrates the basic arithmetic operations using two integer variables, a and b. It calculates and prints the sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder of a and b.

Code Breakdown:
Variable Declarations:
int a = 10, b = 3;
Two integer variables a and b are declared and initialized.
a is set to 10, and b is set to 3. These values will be used in the arithmetic operations.
Sum Calculation:

cout << "Sum: " << a + b << endl;
The program calculates the sum of a and b using the + operator.
The result of a + b (which is 10 + 3 = 13) is printed using cout.
<< is the stream insertion operator, which is used to output the result.
endl adds a newline after the output.
Difference Calculation:

cout << "Difference: " << a - b << endl;
The program calculates the difference between a and b using the - operator.
The result of a - b (which is 10 - 3 = 7) is printed.
Product Calculation:

cout << "Product: " << a * b << endl;
The program calculates the product of a and b using the * operator.
The result of a * b (which is 10 * 3 = 30) is printed.
Quotient Calculation:
cout << "Quotient: " << a / b << endl;
The program calculates the quotient of a divided by b using the / operator.
The result of a / b (which is 10 / 3 = 3 in integer division) is printed.
Note: Since both a and b are integers, the division will result in an integer, and the decimal part will be discarded.
Remainder Calculation:
cout << "Remainder: " << a % b << endl;
The program calculates the remainder of a divided by b using the % operator.
The result of a % b (which is 10 % 3 = 1) is printed.
