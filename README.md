Contribution Guidelines: Ways to extend or modify the system


This C++ program is a professional-grade Attendance Report Generator designed to streamline student attendance tracking and analysis. Built with object-oriented programming principles, it efficiently manages attendance records while generating detailed daily reports and trend analyses. The system supports dynamic record management (add/remove entries) and produces insightful reports with attendance percentages.

Key features include:
1: Polymorphic report generation (Daily & Trend Reports)
2: Dynamic memory management (no leaks)
3: Clean console-based interface
4: Extensible architecture for future enhancements

Ideal for educators and institutions, this tool demonstrates C++ best practices, including inheritance, abstraction, and RAII principles. Compiles with any C++11+ compiler.

 Overview

This system allows users to:
- Add attendance records.
- Remove existing records.
- Generate two types of reports:
  1. *Daily Attendance Report*
  2. *Attendance Trend Report*
This C++ program efficiently manages student attendance records using dynamic memory allocation and polymorphic reporting. The system stores attendance data in resizable arrays of AttendanceRecord structs (containing student IDs, dates, and statuses) and generates two report types via an abstract ReportInterface base class:

DailyAttendanceReport displays chronological records

TrendAttendanceReport calculates attendance percentages

Key features include manual memory management (with proper cleanup), deep copying of dates, and a menu-driven interface for adding/removing records. The design showcases OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism while maintaining efficiency through pointer arithmetic.


It showcases key C++ concepts such as:
- Abstract classes and virtual functions.
- Inheritance and polymorphism.
- Pointer arithmetic.
- Dynamic memory management.

 Technologies Used
- *Language:* C++  
- *Compiler:* Any C++11+ compatible compiler  
- *Platform:* Console (CLI),
 THERFORE The Attendance Report Generator demonstrates how clean C++ design and object-oriented principles can create a practical, efficient solution for attendance tracking. With its polymorphic reporting, dynamic memory management, and user-friendly interface, this project serves as both a functional tool for educators and a learning resource for developers.
Whether used in academic institutions or as a reference for C++ best practices, the system proves that well structured code leads to maintainable, scalable software. Future enhancements like database integration or a GUI could expand its capabilities even further.
